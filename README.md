# Assignment 2: COVID
This repository contains code and analysis of COVID-19 cases in the United States, using data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/).


## Analysis Reflections
As you follow the instructions in the `analysis.R` file, you will be prompted to write six (6) _reflections_ interpreting the results of your code. Those reflections should do in this section.

Each reflection should be about 2-3 sentences long. You can organize the reflections into an _ordered list_ or otherwise label which is which.

1. Take counties and states' csv file as a example, I guess that each row represent: on which date a case or death happened in where. And fips code help us seperate them. I guess firest two digits are states and last three digits are representing counties.

2. Lowest cases in Northern Mariana Islands. Maybe islands can prevent virus to come in.

3. They are different, they are Los Angeles and New York City. We can't ignore any different but meaningful features in analysis, even though they are vey close to each other.

4. There three big waves in the plot. First one are breakout period, that telling us that many people was infected before brekout. Second small wave tells me that some methods we were using are not enough to keep patients alive. Third wave tells that some hospitals overloading.

5. Locations in the middle of the countries or those islands have lower infection ratio.

6. The relection 4 suppresied me most. I believed that more infection, more death. But truth is they are different, and we need to take care all features.
