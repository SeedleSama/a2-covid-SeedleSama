# Assignment 2: COVID
This repository contains code and analysis of COVID-19 cases in the United States, using data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/).


## Analysis Reflections
As you follow the instructions in the `analysis.R` file, you will be prompted to write six (6) _reflections_ interpreting the results of your code. Those reflections should do in this section.

Each reflection should be about 2-3 sentences long. You can organize the reflections into an _ordered list_ or otherwise label which is which.
